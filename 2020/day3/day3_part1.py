You start on the open square (.) in the top-left corner and need to reach the
bottom (below the bottom-most row on your map).

The toboggan can only follow a few specific slopes (you opted for a cheaper
model that prefers rational numbers); start by counting all the trees you
would encounter for the slope right 3, down 1:

From your starting position at the top-left, check the position that is right
3 and down 1. Then, check the position that is right 3 and down 1 from there,
and so on until you go past the bottom of the map.

The locations you'd check in the above example are marked here with O where
there was an open square and X where there was a tree:

..##.........##.........##.........##.........##.........##.......  --->
#..O#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..#...#...#..
.#....X..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#..#....#..#.
..#.#...#O#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#..#.#...#.#
.#...##..#..X...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#..#...##..#.
..#.##.......#.X#.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.......#.##.....  --->
.#.#.#....#.#.#.#.O..#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#.#.#.#....#

.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...X.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#.#..#...#.#  --->

In this example, traversing the map using this slope would cause you to
encounter 7 trees.

Starting at the top-left corner of your map and following a slope of right 3
and down 1, how many trees would you encounter?
