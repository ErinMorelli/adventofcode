--- Part Two ---

It seems like the `X` register controls the horizontal position of a
[sprite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprite_\(computer_graphics\)).
Specifically, the sprite is 3 pixels wide, and the `X` register sets the
horizontal position of the middle of that sprite. (In this system, there is no
such thing as "vertical position": if the sprite's horizontal position puts
its pixels where the CRT is currently drawing, then those pixels will be
drawn.)

You count the pixels on the CRT: 40 wide and 6 high. This CRT screen draws the
top row of pixels left-to-right, then the row below that, and so on. The left-
most pixel in each row is in position `0`, and the right-most pixel in each
row is in position `39`.

Like the CPU, the CRT is tied closely to the clock circuit: the CRT draws a
single pixel during each cycle. Representing each pixel of the screen as a
`#`, here are the cycles during which the first and last pixel in each row are
drawn:

    Cycle   1 -> ######################################## <- Cycle  40
    Cycle  41 -> ######################################## <- Cycle  80
    Cycle  81 -> ######################################## <- Cycle 120
    Cycle 121 -> ######################################## <- Cycle 160
    Cycle 161 -> ######################################## <- Cycle 200
    Cycle 201 -> ######################################## <- Cycle 240

So, by [carefully](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_the_Beam)
[timing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJFnWZH5FXc) the CPU instructions and
the CRT drawing operations, you should be able to determine whether the sprite
is visible the instant each pixel is drawn. If the sprite is positioned such
that one of its three pixels is the pixel currently being drawn, the screen
produces a lit pixel (`#`); otherwise, the screen leaves the pixel dark (`.`).

The first few pixels from the larger example above are drawn as follows:

Allowing the program to run to completion causes the CRT to produce the
following image:

    ##..##..##..##..##..##..##..##..##..##..
    ###...###...###...###...###...###...###.
    ####....####....####....####....####....
    #####.....#####.....#####.....#####.....
    ######......######......######......####
    #######.......#######.......#######.....

Render the image given by your program. What eight capital letters appear on
your CRT?
